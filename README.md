# Lumber Tycoon 2 Wood Script


In Lumber Tycoon 2 (LT2) on Roblox, a wood script can refer to various types of scripts related to
wood mechanics, such as chopping, selling, or automatically detecting wood types. These scripts
typically help automate or modify aspects of the wood-collecting process, such as making it easier to
cut trees, detect rare trees, or automatically transport logs.

# Example Script Explanation:

**Example Script Explanation:**

This kind of script makes cutting down trees faster by automating or speeding up the chopping
process. It can automatically swing the axe or make trees fall after fewer hits.

**Wood Selling Script**

This script allows for automatic wood selling. Once a player chops a tree, the script can transport
the wood to a selling point, making the selling process easier and more efficient.

**Wood Type Detection Script**

A script that helps detect specific types of wood (like spook wood or blue wood) and leads
players to those trees. This can be useful for gathering rare woods without manually searching
the entire map.

**Script Usage Consideration**

- **Fair Play**  Using unauthorized scripts can result in bans from the game or Roblox itself, as they
often violate Roblox’s Terms of Service. Always ensure that any scripts used are permitted by the
game's creator.

- **Custom Scripting** If you're working on a custom wood-related script, it could include logic for
wood chopping, tracking resources, or organizing wood types based on value.

# Features of a Wood Script in LT2

1. **Automatic Tree Chopping** Automatically locates and chops trees within a certain radius
   
2. **Wood Sorting** Sorts wood based on type (e.g., Oak, Pine, Birch) and organizes it for easier
   processing or selling.
   
3. **Log Transporting** Moves cut logs to a designated area or truck for transportation to the
sawmill.

4. **Sawmill Automation** Automatically feeds logs into the sawmill and processes them into planks.

-- Basic Wood Script for Lumber Tycoon 2

local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local woodTypes = {"OakTree", "BirchTree", "PineTree"}  -- List of wood types

-- Function to chop nearby trees
function chopWood(woodType)
    local trees = game.Workspace.Trees:GetChildren()
    for _, tree in pairs(trees) do
        if tree.Name == woodType then
            local treePosition = tree.Position
            player.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = CFrame.new(treePosition)
            wait(1)  -- Pause to reach the tree
            game.ReplicatedStorage.ChopTree:FireServer(tree)  -- Chop the tree
        end
    end
end

-- Automatically chop wood by wood type
for _, wood in pairs(woodTypes) do
    chopWood(wood)
end

-- Function to transport logs
function moveLogs()
    local logs = game.Workspace.Logs:GetChildren()
    for _, log in pairs(logs) do
        if log:IsA("Model") and log:FindFirstChild("Wood") then
            log.PrimaryPart = log:FindFirstChild("Wood")
            log:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(CFrame.new(Vector3.new(0, 0, 0)))  -- Replace with destination CFrame
        end
    end
end

-- Call the log moving function
moveLogs()
```


# How the Script Works:

1. **Tree Detection** The script scans for trees of certain wood types (Oak, Birch, Pine) within the
game world.

2. **Chopping Action** It automatically moves the player’s character to the tree and chops it.

3. **Log Management** After chopping, it moves the logs to a specified location (e.g., sawmill or
storage area).

# Important Notes

**Usage** Using scripts in Roblox, including Lumber Tycoon 2, can violate the game’s terms of
service, leading to account bans. Be cautious when using third-party scripts.

**Customization** The script can be customized by adding more wood types, adjusting tree
detection radius, or adding more features like auto-selling.
